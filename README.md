# Artix S6 Dotfile and Script Collection
Collection of scripts, dotfiles, and s6 services/configs that I use across my laptop and desktop

***

This repository will be updated as changes to my respective systems are made

any files that differ across systems will have "desktop_" or "laptop_" as a prefix to the original filename. a README.md may be provided in the local folder directory to explain the difference.

Scripts for automated deployment into host systems may be produced as a later time. These do not exist as of 14/09/2025

## Notice: any files deviating from the stated licence will contain a NOTICE.md at the folder's root directory and should be assumed to follow the original author's licence if applicable.
